# Polly-DiscordBot: Simple discord poll-bot that runs on node.js
Polly is designed to be simple and easy to use. For now it is simply a discord poll bot,
but plans are for polly to be a simple, non-bloated general purpose bot. 

As it is polly technically only supports a single discord client, however it will 
respond to multiple ones if the bot is on multiple servers. This is not recommended
as it is currently not designed for this. There are plans to add support for multiple client
support in the future. 

Polly is meant to be ran by those who use it. Therefore there are no ways to join a pre-existing instance of the 
bot to your server, unless someone is offering a service where it runs. This is a bot for those who wish to run it themselves
on their own hardware. It is quite simple.

Requirements to run polly:
- node.js
- Discord application for connecting bot application with bot interface
